      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Kenya is a prominent East African country with diverse topography, deep historical roots, and a vibrant society. With its strategic location on the equator and its historical role in regional politics, trade, and cultural exchanges, Kenya stands as one of the continent's most influential nations. The country borders Tanzania, Uganda, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia, and the Indian Ocean.</p>

    <section id="geography">
      <h2>Geography and Climate</h2>
      <p>Kenya spans over 580,000 square kilometers. Its physical geography includes the Great Rift Valley, highland regions, arid deserts in the north, and a coastal belt with coral reefs and mangrove forests. Mount Kenya is the country's highest point, while Lake Turkana is the world’s largest desert lake. The nation experiences varied climates: humid along the coast, temperate in the highlands, and arid in the north. Rainfall patterns define agricultural productivity and seasonal migration patterns.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="population">
      <h2>People and Demographics</h2>
      <p>Kenya’s population exceeds 52 million and is ethnically diverse, with over 40 ethnic communities. Major groups include the Kikuyu, Luhya, Luo, Kalenjin, and Kamba. The country has both urban and rural population centers, with Nairobi and Mombasa leading as economic hubs. Swahili and English are the official languages. Religion is dominated by Christianity, followed by Islam, particularly along the coast. Kenya has a growing youth demographic, posing both opportunities and policy challenges.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="government">
      <h2>Politics and Governance</h2>
      <p>Kenya operates under a multiparty democratic system established by the 2010 Constitution. It features an executive president, a bicameral parliament, and a devolved county system consisting of 47 administrative regions. The judiciary is independent. Key institutions include the National Assembly, the Senate, and the Supreme Court. Political history includes both peaceful transitions and periods of electoral unrest, notably in 2007–08. Governance reform and accountability remain ongoing national priorities.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="history">
      <h2>Historical Development</h2>
      <p>Archaeological findings place Kenya at the heart of early human evolution, particularly in the Rift Valley. Coastal cities like Mombasa and Lamu flourished as trading ports in the Swahili era, linking Africa to Arabia and Asia. British colonization began in the late 19th century, leading to the formation of the Kenya Colony. Resistance culminated in the Mau Mau uprising. Kenya gained independence in 1963, led by Jomo Kenyatta. Later decades saw single-party rule, liberalization, and the 2010 constitutional overhaul.</p>

    <section id="economy">
      <h2>Economic Profile</h2>
      <p>Kenya is classified as a lower-middle-income country. Key industries include agriculture (especially tea, coffee, and horticulture), services, manufacturing, and technology. Nairobi is a major financial and technological hub, sometimes referred to as Silicon Savannah. The national development agenda is framed by Vision 2030, which seeks economic transformation through investment in infrastructure, education, and innovation. Challenges include income inequality, inflation, and dependency on climate-sensitive sectors.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="ecology">
      <h2>Biodiversity and Conservation</h2>
      <p>Kenya hosts an extraordinary variety of ecosystems, including savannas, forests, wetlands, and coral reefs. The country is home to the “Big Five” (lion, elephant, buffalo, rhino, and leopard), as well as endemic birds, amphibians, and plant species. National parks like Maasai Mara, Amboseli, and Tsavo are globally recognized for wildlife conservation and eco-tourism. Conservation efforts address threats such as habitat loss, poaching, and climate change. Community conservancies are playing a growing role in sustainable land and wildlife management.</p>
